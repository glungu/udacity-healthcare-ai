    "# Anonymizing DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will try your hand at anonymizing a DICOM series. It is very important to understand what is involved in anonymization and how it is done if you are planning to do any research projects with real clnical data. Either you will need to agree with the data owner on what the anonymization protocol is, or you will be dealing with data that passed such protocol. As always, understanding your data helps you build better machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find the series in a directory called `data`. By the way, that is an image of my own knee MRI that is coming directly from a scanner, with minimal editing. Among other things HIPAA guarantees patients access to their own data and lets them share the data as they see fit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, imagine that you are starting a joint research project with a hospital and they have given you a sample image series to agree on anonymiaztion protocol for their data. You will need to come up with one before you see any further data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will guide you through a thought process for approaching such task, and have you perform the actual de-identification of DICOM metadata (note that there is also a lot that could be done with pixels, but we leave it outside the scope of this exercise). \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that anonymization process is always a balance between reducing chances of re-identification to a reasonable minimum and keeping the dataset useful for your research purposes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important disclaimer - while it is very useful to understand what exactly is involved in anonymization so that you can nail this balance perfectly, it is always a good idea to evaluate existing de-identification libraries for your task first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be relying on PyDicom here, it's good to keep the reference handy: https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/dataset_basics.html"

Options may be things like the intent to retain longitudinal information with full dates, or the intent to retain device identity. This is very convenient since this way the standard provides a common language to speak about identification. I.e. you may communicate in your release notes (or research protocol) that you perform DICOM anonymization per Basic Profile with \"Clean Descriptiors\" and \"Clean Graphics\" options, and everyone will be able to understand what that means exactly by looking up the respective pages in the standard.  \n",

    "* Try implementing the profile without the \"Retain UIDs\" option. How would you mangle DICOM UIDs without invalidating DICOM files while maintaining internal consistency?\n",
    "* Try implementing the [\"Retain Longitudinal Temporal Information Option\"](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2020a/output/chtml/part15/sect_E.3.6.html). This option declares the approach where temporal information about the dataset is retained. For example, you may be building an AI tool that draws inference from a set of images taken from the same patient over some period of time (also called longitudinal studies). In this case, the temporal relationship between such images becomes important and you can still keep the dataset de-identified per HIPAA while retaining this information"
