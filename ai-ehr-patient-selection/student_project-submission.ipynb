    "**Context**: You are a data scientist for an exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing. It is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring/testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application. You have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.  \n",

    "In order to achieve your goal you must build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and use this to select/filter patients for your study.\n"

    "\n",

The challenge is that there are many codes that map to the same or similar drug. You are provided with the ndc drug lookup file https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c1-emr-data-starter/tree/master/project/data_schema_references/ndc_lookup_table.csv derived from the National Drug Codes List site(https://ndclist.com/).
